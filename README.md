CLASS ACTIVITY GIVEN ON THE 28th of May 2024
QUESTION: 
How were you able to achieve writing a code to check if a word is a palindrome or not?
As a group, we were able to work with the clues given to us by the lecturer although still without a clear path on how to solve the problem.
We didn’t implement a function which would have been an optimal solution instead we wrote the code in such a way that the words to be tested would be manually overwritten as the user wills to use them. 
The program is written such that the ‘char array’ which has a method that helps to read the individual characters of the string is utilized in a for loop whereby the program checks each index of the array
- and compares it with the reverse order of the array using the equality operator. Plus we created dummy variable with the key word’ dum’ to be used as a test element in the conditional operators, and
- then the conditional operators were well-defined to determine the output which is whether the word is a palindrome or not.
