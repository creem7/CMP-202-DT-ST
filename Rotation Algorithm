The program shifts each element of an array to the left by a specified number of rotations. For example, given an array `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` and `2` rotations, the output should be `{3, 4, 5, 1, 2}`.
Function: `rotLeft`and the function parameters are as follows:
  int[] a: Input array of integers.
  int d: Number of left rotations.
These are the steps:
  1. Determine the length of the array n.
  2. Create a new array result to store the rotated values.
  3. Calculate new positions for each element using (i + n - d) % n.
  4. Assign the values to the result array.
  5. Print the result array as space-separated integers.
The initial errors we made were that the original implementation had complex conditions and didn't handle rotation logic properly and also we incorrectly used the indices which led to out-of-bounds errors and wrong assignments.
Lastly, We consulted AI sources to understand better array manipulation and simplify the function. The AI provided a clear, efficient approach using basic loops and array operations. This helped in correcting and streamlining the implementation.
